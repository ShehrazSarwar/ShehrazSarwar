# üåü About Me:
Passionate Computer Scientist with a deep interest in technology. I am currently a student at IUGC and a former Silver Medalist at FAST National University. Exploring the power of Python, along with Data Science and AI, I aim to enhance my knowledge of emerging technologies. I have expertise in C, C++, and Java, having completed several projects that strengthen my problem-solving skills.

Mathematics fascinates me, especially its applications in Computer Science. While studying math courses at university, I either implement concepts through coding or explore their real-world applications. I believe that learning becomes meaningful when approached differently. Earning a degree isn't just about grades, but about truly understanding how computers work and how they have evolved over the years.

Beyond programming, I have honed skills in video editing and Low Poly 3D Art. Recently, I explored UI/UX design through a foundational UX course, further expanding my understanding of user experience. My main goal is to become a great Computer Scientist, and I am actively deepening my knowledge of AI, Data Science, and Python, the driving forces behind modern technology.
